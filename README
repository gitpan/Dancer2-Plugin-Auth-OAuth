NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::OAuth - OAuth for your Dancer2 app

SYNOPSIS
      # just 'use' the plugin, that's all.
      use Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::OAuth;

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::OAuth is a Dancer2 plugin which tries to make
    OAuth authentication easy.

    The module is highly influenced by Plack::Middleware::OAuth and Dancer 1
    OAuth modules, but unlike the Dancer 1 versions, this plugin only needs
    configuration (look mom, no code needed!). It automatically sets up the
    needed routes (defaults to "/auth/$provider" and
    "/auth/$provider/callback"). So if you define the Twitter provider in
    your config, you should automatically get "/auth/twitter" and
    "/auth/twitter/callback".

    After a successful OAuth dance, the user info is stored in the session.
    What you do with it afterwards is up to you.

CONFIGURATION
    The plugin comes with support for Facebook, Google and Twitter (other
    providers aren't hard to add, send me a pull request when you add more!)

    All it takes to use OAuth authentication for a given provider, is to add
    the configuration for it.

    The YAML below shows all available options.

      plugins:
        "Auth::OAuth":
          prefix: /auth [*]
          success_url: / [*]
          error_url: / [*]
          providers:
            Facebook:
              tokens:
                client_id: your_client_id
                client_secret: your_client_secret
            Google:
              tokens:
                client_id: your_client_id
                client_secret: your_client_secret
            Twitter:
              tokens:
                consumer_key: your_consumer_token
                consumer_secret: your_consumer_secret

    [*] default value, may be omitted.
